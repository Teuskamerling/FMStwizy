	<h3>Introduction to Object Dictionary Editor</h3>
	<p>CANopen Object dictionary is a collection of all the data items inside one device, which are accessible via CANopen network. Data items have  specific type, for example UNSIGNED8, INTEGER32, VISIBLE_STRING, RECORD(structure in C), ARRAY, etc. Each data item within the object dictionary is addressed using a 16-bit index and an 8-bit sub-index.</p>
   <p>Objec dictionary editor is used for editing and creation of CANopenNode project specific files. Main project file is an XML file - device description file - <b>_project.xml</b>. It contains all CANopen specific information about one device. For example, it contains all the information, which are usually present in Electronic Data Sheel (EDS) file + much more. Other files created from device description file are: CANopen <b>EDS file</b>, <b>HTML file</b> as documentation and two C language files: <b>CO_OD.h</b> and <b>CO_OD.c</b>.</p>
	<p>Objec dictionary editor is a web application. Currently it has a little uncommon user interface. After files are created, they must be copy/pasted to regular text editor (notepad) and saved from there. Web application does not allow saving files directly.</p>
